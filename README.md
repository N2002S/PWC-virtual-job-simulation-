# PWC-virtual-job-simulation-

**Welcome to PwC Switzerland’s Power BI virtual job simulation**

At PwC Switzerland, we aim to strategically implement new technology across the company, impacting all employees and processes. Our goal is to build innovative solutions that set us apart and digitize our business. To achieve this, we’ve invested in upskilling programs to teach our people how to use digital tools for data visualization, automation, data cleansing, and more.

By leveraging these tools, our employees can solve common problems, making us more efficient and growth-oriented now, and more innovative in the future. So far, over 2,400 bots have been created to automate workflows. We continue to invest in making processes more intuitive using machine learning, Power BI, and eventually AI, to work faster and solve problems differently for ourselves and our clients.

**Digital Accelerator Programme**

Our Digital Accelerator programme takes employees out of their day jobs and puts them through training in technology skills such as automation, machine learning, design thinking, and digital storytelling. Power BI is a crucial part of this, as visualizing data helps us understand and handle client needs.

**Task 1: Call Centre Trends**

Create a Power BI dashboard for Claire that includes relevant KPIs and metrics. Possible KPIs include:

-Overall customer satisfaction
-Overall calls answered/abandoned
-Calls by time
-Average speed of answer.
-Agent’s performance quadrant (average handle time vs. calls answered)

**Task 2: Customer Retention**

Your colleague, the engagement partner, asks you to:

-Define proper KPIs.
-Create a dashboard for the retention manager reflecting these KPIs.
-Write a short email explaining your findings and suggesting changes.

**Task 3: Diversity & Inclusion**

Calculate the following measures to define proper KPIs:

-Number of men and women
-Number of leavers
-% employees promoted (FY21)
-% of women promoted
-% of hires (men and women)
-% turnover
-Average performance rating (men and women)

Define relevant KPIs in hiring, promotion, performance, and turnover, and create a visualization. Also, write about potential root causes of slow progress.
